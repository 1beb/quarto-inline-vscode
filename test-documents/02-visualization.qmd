## Plotting mtcars Data

```{r}
# Simple scatter plot
plot(mtcars$wt, mtcars$mpg,
     xlab = "Weight (1000 lbs)",
     ylab = "Miles per Gallon",
     main = "MPG vs Weight")
```

```{r}
# Histogram of MPG
hist(mtcars$mpg,
     breaks = 10,
     col = "skyblue",
     main = "Distribution of MPG",
     xlab = "Miles per Gallon")
```

```{r}
# Boxplot by cylinder
boxplot(mpg ~ cyl, data = mtcars,
        xlab = "Number of Cylinders",
        ylab = "Miles per Gallon",
        main = "MPG by Cylinder Count",
        col = c("lightblue", "lightgreen", "lightcoral"))
```
